<br>AchievementService is an open-source module designed to make managing and awarding achievements in your games easy and customizable. With built-in support for UI animations, haptics, audio, and more, you can create engaging achievement experiences for your players.

<h2>‚≠ê Features</h2>

<h4> 1. Awarding Badges</h4>
AchievementService makes it simple to award badges to players in your game.

```lua
AchievementService:Award(player, badgeName)
```
That‚Äôs it! No need to specify the `BadgeId` anymore. AchievementService uses **HTTPService** and Roblox APIs to automatically fetch all the available badges for your game, making the process much easier and more efficient. *Please note that issues may occur if there are two or more badges with the exact same name.*


<h4> 2. Customizable Animations</h4>
AchievementService provides an option to toggle customizable UI animations. It also includes a default animation for easy use. You can either use the default UI or design your own. <i>I recommend using the existing script in the default UI as a template if you decide to create your own.</i>

<h4> 3. Audio Support</h4>
AchievementService allows for customizable sounds, allowing you to toggle and add audios. I've also included a pack of 25 classic Roblox audios with the module. <sub>lol</sub>

<h4> 4. Haptic Feedback</h4>
AchievementService even allows for haptics, allowing for tactile response to mobile and possibly console players.

<h4> 5. Fully Open-Source</h4>
AchievementService is entirely open-source, allowing you to modify and extend the module as needed for your game.

<h2>üî® Installation Guide</h2>

* Copy the AchievementService module into your game.
* Enable `Allow HTTP Requests` in your game settings under the security tab.

<h4>2. Initialization</h4>

```lua
local AchievementService = require(PATH_TO_MODULE.AchievementService)

  * Released

<h2>üåê Miscellaneous</h2>

* Developed and created by @FuntMaster.
* One thing to note is that AchievementService uses **[RoProxy](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/roproxycom-a-free-rotating-proxy-for-roblox-apis/1508367)** to access Roblox Badge APIs. Although rare, I cannot control any downtime or slowdown that occur with this proxy. If you're worried about that, I'd recommend using your own self-hosted proxy or some other way to access Roblox Badge APIs. (If someone has a better way of accessing the API, lmk!)
* Lastly, please feel free to let me know of any bugs, issues, suggestions that you have!
<br><sub>P.S. this is my first time making a Github respository!</sub>
